# Minimal Binder C language example

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ohm-efi-professorfreudenreich/jupyter-binder-c/HEAD?labpath=index.ipynb)

This is a minimal example for a Jupyter C language notebook using https://github.com/adamtuft/c-kernel. Click the "launch binder" button below to start an interactive session.ronment.yml`, which you would have to manually prune from `environment.yml`.  For example, confirmed macOS-specific packages that should be removed are:

* libcxxabi=4.0.1
* appnope=0.1.0
* libgfortran=3.0.1
* libcxx=4.0.1
